# üõí SuperReminder üõí
**SuperReminder** is a mobile application designed to simplify shopping list management and price comparison. This project is my final prject in **Software Engineering class**, and is currently **in development**. The app leverages modern technologies to provide a seamless and efficient user experience for managing shopping needs.

## üìñ About the Project
The goal of SuperReminder is to offer users an intuitive way to manage their shopping lists, and make informed purchasing decisions by comparing supermarket prices. 
The application integrates powerful tools and technologies, enabling users to create, organize, and optimize their shopping experience effectively.

## ‚ú® Features Implemented So Far
### 1. Shopping List Management
* Create new shopping lists stored locally using Realm Database.
* Edit and delete lists as needed.
* Sort and filter lists for better organization.
* Search and add new items to lists.
### 2. Barcode Scanning
* Scan product barcodes to view all of its' info and compare prices across multiple supermarkets.

  * Shufersal Yesh Hesed
  * Tiv Taam
  * Rami Levi
  * Hazi Hinam
  * Stop Market
  * Osherad

  Supermarket data is dynamically fetched via Firebase, supported by an API I developed ([Supermarket Database Updater](https://github.com/Gal-Izhaky/public-supermarket-database-updater))
### 4. Seamless Navigation
* Navigate effortlessly between pages with a user-friendly interface. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
* **React Native**: Built using the Expo CLI with an Expo development build.
